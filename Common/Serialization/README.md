# Serialization
Serialization is the conversion of a in-memory .NET object to another format such as XML, JSON, etc. so that they can be stored or transmitted. This format is usually text i.e. a string of characters.

> Serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. - Wikipedia
